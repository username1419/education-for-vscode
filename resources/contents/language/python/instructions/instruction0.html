        <p id="explanation">
            <b>Computers</b>, since their inception, has stored information as '1's and 
            '0's, or binary. Data types are used by them to interpret these chains of 
            binary information and process them. In Python, this information is 
            separated into 6 basic data types.<br><br>

            <b>Characters and Words</b> in Python are written in single - <code>'a'</code>
            , <code>'word'</code> - or double quotes - <code>"a"</code>, <code>"word"</code>.<br>
            <b>Truth values</b> in Python are represented by <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.<br>
            <b>Whole numbers</b> in Python are written as is - <code>-1</code>, <code>2</code><br>
            <b>Real numbers with decimal points</b> in Python are also written as is - 
            <code>0.1</code>, <code>-0.2</code>.<br>
            <b>The absence of a value</b> is represented in Python as the word <code>None</code>.
        </p><br>

            <b>
                To demonstrate your understanding of this, write 3 values of each data type, 
                each separated by a line break in between and submit your response by entering
                the Command Palette using <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>P</code>,
                type <code>Education for VSCode: Submit Code</code>, and press <code>Enter</code>
